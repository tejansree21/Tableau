# Tableau

Tableau is a powerful data visualization tool that can be used for data analytics to visualize the data and get a clear opinion 
based on data analysis.

Dashboard
A dashboard could also be a set of several views letting you compare a selection of data simultaneously. 

=> In Tableau while working with your dataset if you have empty rows and columns you can use the data interpreter to make it one 
complete table.
